# California Mobility Works - Website Redesign

The purpose of this project is to redesign the California Mobility Works website, giving it a more modern and mobile-friendly look.
This is to assist the company in its search for an investorâ€”-as a website that professionally and concisely conveys what the company is about is sure to impress and stand out in a crowd of EV ventures.
